Methodology

In this analysis, we examined a dataset containing various attributes related to digital marketing campaigns. The goal was to gain insights into campaign performance, understand the impact of different attributes, and provide recommendations for future campaigns. We obtained a dataset that included information on campaign attributes, such as post type, sentiment, style, call-to-action, spending, and more. Data preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality. We conducted EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and explore relationships between attributes. EDA helped us uncover key insights. Statistical tests and correlation analyses were used to quantify relationships between variables and assess their significance. We built predictive models to understand the impact of different attributes on campaign performance.
