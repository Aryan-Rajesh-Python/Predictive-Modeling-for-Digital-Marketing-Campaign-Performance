Methodology
In this analysis, we examined a dataset containing various attributes related to digital marketing campaigns. The goal was to gain insights into campaign performance, understand the impact of different attributes, and provide recommendations for future campaigns. The following methodology was employed:
Data Collection: We obtained a dataset that included information on campaign attributes, such as post type, sentiment, style, call-to-action, spending, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and explore relationships between attributes. EDA helped us uncover key insights.
Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests and correlation analyses were used to quantify relationships between variables and assess their significance.
Machine Learning Modeling: We built predictive models to understand the impact of different attributes on campaign performance.
